A developer link landing page for your social media

I've been searching for a link based landing page for a little while and have come across some simple ones and wanted some pizzaz. Then one caught my eye, but required a minium of a certain amount of followers (read: clout) to have their special stamp of approval and gain access to their interface. So, I made my own. 

Github Pages provides a perfect hosting spot for a landing page that links you to other links that you find interesting and important to you like your portfolio, linkedin, github etc.  

How to use: 

Step 1.
Fork

Step 2.
Change variables 

Step 3.
Push to Github Pages

Step 4.
Put link in bio and showcase your links with style
